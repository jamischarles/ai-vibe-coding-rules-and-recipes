# ai-vibe-coding-rules-and-recipes
A collection of good prompts and instructions and recipes that you can point your AI agent at instead of having to copy/paste it.

Think of it as an abstraction on top of your agent. So you can give your agent an instruction set ie: "Follow the X method". And it'll automatically become a dev who follows those methodolgois. That's an all-in approach. OR you can pick and choose. Similar to linting rulesets... Linting for AI? 


## AI vibe coding workflows
- one shot
- docs-driven: Create a PRD.md, tasks.md, etc and use that as the primary driver for the AI. Chats frequently become "do X, make sure you update the PRD, tasks, and tests to conform.
- business process driven: this assumes that the app you're building exists to follow/enforce/track a business process the company relies on. In this format you create a detailed document with business processes. Then the first directive for the AIAG (AI Agent) is: follow the business process, and everything you do with the app needs to support that process.
