# vibe-coding-instruction-sets
A collection of good prompts and instructions and recipes that you can point your AI agent at instead of having to copy/paste it.

Think of it as a custom instruction set for your robot to help keep it humming and not go rogue a l√† Murderbot.

And it'll automatically become a dev who follows those methodologies. You can go all-in, or pick & choose.

Hypothesis: This should result in DRASTICALLY faster and clearer outcomes (produced code/app) because your ruleset will be tuned for the outcome you desire.

Proof: These are the rules I tune to have my vibe coding sessions humming. Tuned over hundreds of hours of vibe coding real products for real customers.

## AI vibe coding workflows
- one shot
- docs-driven: Create a PRD.md, tasks.md, etc and use that as the primary driver for the AI. Chats frequently become "do X, make sure you update the PRD, tasks, and tests to conform.
- business process driven: this assumes that the app you're building exists to follow/enforce/track a business process the company relies on. In this format you create a detailed document with business processes. Then the first directive for the AIAG (AI Agent) is: follow the business process, and everything you do with the app needs to support that process.
